# Instructions to fix permission error:
# 1. Check that you have the correct SSH key added to your ssh-agent and GitHub account.
# 2. Run `ssh-add -l` to list keys loaded in your ssh-agent.
# 3. Ensure your ssh-agent is running and your key is added, e.g. `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
# 4. Verify you can connect to GitHub via SSH: `ssh -T git@github.com`.
# 5. Confirm that the remote repository URL is correctly using SSH (git@github.com:Shashivadan/kafka.git).
# 6. If the user is authenticated as a different GitHub user, switch to the correct one or reconfigure remote.
# 7. If needed, remove existing remote and add it again with the correct URL.
